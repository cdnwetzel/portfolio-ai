# Periodic hands-free canary for the portfolio AI chat — the SECOND, external vantage.
#
# Runs the self-test battery against the LIVE PUBLIC endpoint from the home network, so it
# exercises the full Apache→proxy→tunnel→T5810 path exactly as a visitor would — catching
# public-path breakage (SSL, Apache, DNS) that the VPS-internal aggregator can't see. The
# VPS-side scripts/health_aggregate.py is the primary deep monitor; this is the cheap
# home-side complement.
#
# Install on the T5810 (it has .venv-diag with `websockets`; keeps test deps off the VPS).
#
# On regression it pushes an ntfy alert (same channel as the VPS monitor) AND exits non-zero.
# Set NTFY_URL to your private topic — without it, it only logs + exits non-zero (relying on
# cron MAILTO, which is easy to miss). Config lives in /etc/portfolio-canary.env if present.
#
# Install (cron, every 30 min, on the T5810):
#   */30 * * * * /home/user/ai/cwdotcom/scripts/selftest-canary.sh >> /var/log/portfolio-selftest.log 2>&1
